			<a href="https://itea3.org/project/emphysis.html">EMPHYSIS</a> (Embedded systems with physical models in the production code software)
            is an ITEA3 research project that is running in 2017-2020.
	        The major goal of the EMPHYSIS project is to develop a new standard (FMI for embedded systems) to exchange 
			physics-based models between modelling and simulation environments with software development environments
			for electronic control units (ECU), micro controllers or other embedded systems
         and provide prototype implementations for the whole tool chain from physics-based modeling environments
         to production code on electronic control units. Enabling advanced control 
			and diagnosis functions based on physical models allows the production code in automotive vehicles to be
			enhanced and the cost and time for the software development of these embedded systems to be reduced.
