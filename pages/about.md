## EMPHYSIS Project

The major goal of the ITEA project [EMPHYSIS](https://itea3.org/project/emphysis.html)  is to develop a new standard (eFMI: FMI for embedded systems) to exchange physics-based models between modelling and simulation environments with software development environments for electronic control units (ECU), micro controllers or other embedded systems. Enabling advanced control and diagnosis functions based on physical models allows the production code in automotive vehicles to be enhanced and the cost and time for the software development of these embedded systems to be reduced.

## Modelica Association Project (MAP) eFMI

It is planned to perform the further development of eFMI as [Modelica Association Project](https://modelica.org/projects)
_Functional Mock-up Interface for Embedded Systems_ under the roof of the [Modelica Association](https://www.modelica.org/).

# Standardization Projects and Groups Related to eFMI

## MAP Modelica

The Modelica Language is a non-proprietary, object-oriented, equation based language to conveniently model complex physical systems containing, e.g., mechanical, electrical, electronic, hydraulic, thermal, control, electric power or process-oriented subcomponents. 

Link to [project page](https://www.modelica.org/modelicalanguage).


## MAP FMI

The Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) is a free standard that defines a container and an interface to exchange dynamic models using a combination of XML files, binaries and C code zipped into a single file. It is supported by 150+ tools and maintained as a Modelica Association Project on GitHub. The code is released under the 2-Clause BSD, the docs under the CC-BY-SA License.

## MAP SSP
In many applications there is the need to design, simulate and execute a network of components (simulation models,
software, hardware etc.).
In order to be able to do this tool independently and seamlessly,
the purposes of the “System Structure and Parameterization of Components for Virtual System Design (SSP)” project are:

 - Define a standardized way to store and apply parameters to these components.
 - Define a standardized format for the connection structure for a network of components.
 - The developed standard / APIs should be usable in all stages of development process (architecture definition, integration, simulation, test in MiL, SiL, HiL).

## MAP DCP

The DCP is a platform and communication medium independent standard for the integration
of real-time systems into simulation environments.
The DCP is standardized by the Modelica Association, where it is maintained as a Modelica Association Project (MAP).

Whereas the FMI represents an application programming interface (API), the DCP represents a communication protocol.
Therefore, it becomes possible to integrate various kinds of systems.
The DCP specification is suitable for a broad range of computing platforms.
It may be implemented on hardware as well as in software.
Typical examples are middleware, runtime environments, (virtualized) operating systems, electronic control units, FPGAs, and many more.

## ASAM XIL-MA

The ITEA2 project MODELISAR noticed the parallel work of the ASAM XIL standardization group.
Both groups came discussed and concluded not to develop a parallel standard but to cooperate.
The result of this cooperation is available as ASAM XIL-MA, which is a subset from ASAM XIL standard.
XIL-MA is open to public and the documentation of the standard can be obtained from ASAM for free without membership.

## ProSTEP Smart System Engineering

One of the topics of the Smart Systems Engineering project is to find solutions for
the cross-disciplinary and cross-enterprise exchange of behavioral models.
The Functional Mockup Interface (FMI) is viewed as the basic technology for the exchange.
