<h2>Example eFMU</h2>

<p>
Example eFMU with Algorithm Code, Production Code, Binary Code and Behavioral Model containers for an embedded torque controller.
</p>
<p>
The Behavioral Model container provides two test scenarios and the original Modelica model defining the controller subject to embedded code generation.
</p>
<p>
The Algorithm Code container provides GALEC code -- i.e., an algorithmic, causal solution -- for the controller; it has been generated by Dymola (Dassault Systèmes).
</p>
<p>
Production code for the Algorithm Code container is generated using three different tools: CATIA ESP (Dassault Systèmes), TargetLink (dSpace GmbH) and SCODA-CONGRA (ETAS GmbH).
For each tool two production codes are generated, a 32 Bit and a 64 Bit floating point precision version.
</p>
<p>
For the 32 Bit production code of ESP, a binary code container with x86 as target architecture has been generated.
</p>
<p>
TPT (PikeTec) has been used to validate each production code against the scenarios of the Behavioral Model container.
The respective test results are stored in <TT>TestResult</TT> folders of their respective Production Code containers.
Note that the precision-related issues of 32 Bit compared to 64 Bit are still within the tolerance defined in the scenario description given in the Behavioral Model container's manifest.
</p>
<p>
Note how manifests link dependent containers for traceability. Production code manifests, for example, link back to the Algorithm Code container
they implement by means of <TT>ManifestReference</TT> and individual <TT>ForeignVariableReference</TT> for each block-variable of the original GALEC code.
eFMU consistency between dependent artefacts is ensured by means of SHA-1 checksums.
For example, the GALEC code of an Algorithm Code container is listed as <TT>File</TT> element with a mandatory checksum;
likewise, the <TT>ManifestReference</TT> of a Production Code container's manifest lists the checksum of the respective Algorithm Code container manifest it implements.
</p>
<p>
The <TT>schemas</TT> folder contains the XSD Schemas for all manifests as defined in the eFMI specification.
The <TT>__content.xml</TT> of the eFMU's root directory lists all containers of the eFMU; it is the unique entry point for reading and working with an eFMU.
