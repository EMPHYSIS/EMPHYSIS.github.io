# Standardization Projects and Groups Related to the EMPHYSIS Project

## [FMI](https://fmi-standard.org)

The Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) is a tool independent standard to support both model
exchange and co-simulation of dynamic models using a combination of xml-files and
compiled C-code.

The FMI development is organised as a Modelica Association Project (MAP) inside the
[Modelica Association](https://www.modelica.org/).


## [Modelica Language](https://www.modelica.org/modelicalanguage)

The Modelica Language is a non-proprietary, object-oriented, equation based language to
conveniently model complex physical systems containing, e.g., mechanical, electrical,
electronic, hydraulic, thermal, control, electric power or process-oriented subcomponents.

The Modelica language development is organised as a Modelica Association Project (MAP) inside the
[Modelica Association](https://www.modelica.org/).
